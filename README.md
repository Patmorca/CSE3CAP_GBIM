<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

Finger Print is a gesture based image manipulation software which leverages the Mediapipe and openCV libraries in order to translate user gestures into commonly used image editing functions. Within Finger Print you can:
* Open common image file formats
* Use hand gestures to perform the following edits:
  * Translate
  * Rotate
  * Crop
  * Resize
  * Contrast
  * Brightness
* Perform meta-functionality such as undo / redo and help
* Export edited images

<h2 align="center">Documentation</h2>

<p align="center">Detailed documentation of Finger Print can be found here: <a href=https://jasonjason5.github.io/CSE3CAP_GBIM/index.html>Finger Print Documentation</a></p>

<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>

Once downloaded, Finger Print requires the dependencies listed at the bottom of this page.
Once all dependencies are accounted for, the software can be run through the IDE of your choice. 

**Alternatively**, it can be compiled into an executable via Nuitka - which was too large to include in this repository. 

This requires you to include Mediapipe location, alongside the Mediapipe model _.task_ file when compliling the Nuitka executable.

<p align="center">Once you start the software, follow the on screen guides to begin.</p>
</br>

**Getting Help With Gestures:**

* Hover your mouse over the pictograph to view an animation of the gesture.
* Click on the pictograph to bring up a help window with more information.
* Attempt the gesture, and then give the "help" gesture.
